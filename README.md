# DFT
Code to calculate DFT for a function
Change the function according to your need in #def func:
n= is the sampling rate.Assign 2X the value of your desired sampling rate to n.
Suppose you want your sampling rate to be 10, then assign n=20
Also the default time period starts from a=0, so to change the intital value of your time period,change a
